## Description
This project is comprised of three C# console applications. This project is to complete the first of three badges in Eleven Fifty Academy's Software Development Bootcamp.

#### **01_Cafe**
The first console app manages a menu for a hypothetical cafe. It allows a manager to see, add, update, and delete menu items. Each menu item holds several pieces of data such as name, ingredients, and price.

#### **02_Claims**
The second console app manages a queue of claims for a hypothetical insurance company. An insurance agent can create claims, update claims, and deal with claims in the order they were received.

#### **03_Badges**
The third console app manages a dictionary of badge numbers and its corresponding access to various doors. A security manager can view the badges, create new badges, and add or remove door access for a specific badge.
